# Request
# closure: desired closure ratio [0.0, 1.0]
float32 closure

# duration_sec: duration-based mode (seconds).
# - If > 0: interpolate to target in duration_sec seconds (speed comes from duration)
# - If = 0: speed-based mode (ignore duration), use speed_ratio + max_step_per_tick
float32 duration_sec

# speed_ratio: speed scale (0.0, 1.0]; smaller is slower.
# Used only when duration_sec == 0.
